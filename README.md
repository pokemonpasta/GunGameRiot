# Heavily Recommended

- [Quake Sounds](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=2019601)
- [Friendly Fire](https://github.com/Mikusch/friendlyfire)

With Friendly fire, its recommended to set `mp_friendlyfire` to `1`

if you do, set `sm_quakesoundsv3_teamkill_mode?` to `1`

# Cvars
-`ggr_weapons_till_win`        def: "25"       -How many kills untill a player wins, it will set itself to the weapon.cfg max amount if exeeded

-`ggr_allowfreeclasspicking`   def: "0"        -Allow players to wear any class for cosmetic reasons, this can very much mess with hitboxes being visible however.
